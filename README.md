# Installation:
Just run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.

# System requirements
I have tested it on several Core 2 Duo machines with no problems. Most important thing is that it has a decent graphics adapter.

It might run on older hardware aswell, just test it, read "known issues" below and judge for yourself.

# Release notes:
Version 1.0.1:
* First public release
  * Burn time adjustment (Now about 2,5 hours per date)

Version 1.0.0:
* Internal test release
  * Flame flickering now no longer cpu dependent

Version 0.9.0:
* Internal test release

# Known issues:
* With some graphics drivers / vendors, the candle might eat up a lot of cpu time. The cause of this is out of my hands, since it has to do with how the driver and Qt makes the window borderless and the background translucent. This has only been observed with an onboard Intel display device on Windoze. Linux doesn't seem to have this problem. If you have a lot of tearing in the graphics while moving the candle around on the desktop, you too have this problem.

Any issues and / or comments concerning the candle can be emailed to me at muldjordlars@gmail.com
